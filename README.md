# Hi, I'm Aske

I'm studying IT and working on various projects related to web development and cybersecurity. I mainly work with React, and I'm learning GoLang. I also explore tools like GoHugo for simpler documentation sites—it's simple and efficient. Below are some of the projects and technologies I’m currently diving into.

## Projects

### 1. Company Policy Automation with GitHub Actions
Using GitHub Actions to automate and manage company policies, making them more accessible and acceptable to employees. This includes automating updates, version control, and approvals to ensure consistency and compliance.

### 3. Blockchain Exploration
Currently learning about blockchain technology to fill in knowledge gaps and work on a project that integrates blockchain for digital signatures and secure transactions.
